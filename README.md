# Connection Issue Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect issues in network connections by leveraging machine learning models. It involves preparing a dataset with multiple features related to connection quality, training a model on this dataset, and then using the model to detect various problems in network connections. The results are outputted in a CSV file for easy analysis.


## Dataset Preparation

### Description

The dataset is compiled to include multiple features essential for identifying poor connection issues. These features include but are not limited to signal strength, latency, packet loss, and throughput.

### Sources

* Data is synthesized from simulated environments to represent various connection scenarios.
* Additional data is not collected from real-world network performance metrics, anonymized to protect privacy. It just collected from
  random values, because is just for test and is a sample.

### Preparation Steps

1. **Data Collection** : Aggregate data from random simulated valid sources.
2. **Cleaning** : Remove any outliers or irrelevant data points to ensure data quality.
3. **Feature Engineering** : Create new features that are vital for predicting connection issues, such as moving averages of signal strength or ratios of successful to lost packets.
4. **Normalization** : Scale the data to ensure that no single feature dominates due to its scale.
5. **Splitting** : Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure model reliability.

## Model Training

### Algorithm Selection

* For selecting the algorithm in train the model, I tried Random Forest and Decision Tree. ln next paragram I explain about them. This project was
  focus on produce for sample data and sample report from training the model so the other steps in machine learning problems didn't continued because I prepare the samples for them and up to now , is enough.

### Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. This algorithm divides the dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

* **Pros:**
  * Simple to understand, interpret, and visualize.
  * Requires little data preparation. No need for data normalization.
  * Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
* **Cons:**
  * Prone to overfitting, especially with a complex tree.
  * Can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.
  * Decision boundary issues: it prefers orthogonal decision boundaries, which can be a problem for certain problems.

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that builds upon the simplicity of decision trees and enhances their performance. It creates a forest of uncorrelated trees to make more accurate and stable predictions. A Random Forest trains multiple decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and averages their predictions. Each tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes the modelâ€™s prediction.

The fundamental concept is that a group of "weak learners" can come together to form a "strong learner". The model uses bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.

* **Pros:**
  * It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.
  * It runs efficiently on large databases.
  * It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
  * Gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.
* **Cons:**
  * Can be slow to generate predictions because it requires generating predictions from each tree in the forest.
  * It can be complex and require more computational resources, due to the large number of trees.
  * Less interpretable than a single decision tree.

### Choosing Between Decision Tree and Random Forest

* Use a **Decision Tree** when you need a quick and easy solution, simplicity, and interpretability over prediction accuracy.
* Use a **Random Forest** when you need high accuracy, can handle more computational complexity, and model interpretability is not a primary concern.

Random Forests often perform well in practice and are widely used because they are robust to overfitting, can handle both categorical and numerical data, and can deal with unbalanced and missing data.

### Training Process

* Steps to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
